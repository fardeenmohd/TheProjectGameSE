**Welcome to the project game thing.**

*How to run the server:*
>python server.py --verbose

Don't add "--verbose" if you don't want verbose mode, obviously.


*How to run the clients:*
>python player.py --verbose -c 2 -m 3

The -c parameter specifies the number of clients to run (default is 1, if not specified).

-m specifies the number of messages each player will send to the server (default is 1, if not specified).
